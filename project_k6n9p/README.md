# Grade Calculator
## Project Overview
The grade calculator is a simple desktop application designed to 
**help students keep track of their grades across numerous classes**. 

The grade calculator will come with *many* functionalities:
- Calculate your current average within one course and across all 
  courses, weighted appropriately
- Calculate what grade you need on the remainder of your
  assignments to achieve your intended grade  
- Add/edit/delete courses and items within courses
- Keep track of your courses throughout the semester
- Enter grades as raw scores (fractions), as well as a decimal 
number or percentage
  

## Intended Audience
This grade calculator has been designed to be **optimal for students**.
However, this can be used by anyone interested in keeping track 
of marks, such as teachers and parents.

## Why did I build this project?
I typically spend a lot of time during finals season using Ben Eggleston's
online grade calculator (https://www.thegradecalculator.com/ -- it's great), 
calculating the mark I need to get on the final to achieve my intended grade
instead of actually studying for my finals. However, there are two main problems 
I had with this site:

1. You can not enter fractions. This was often a pain, because I received many
of my marks as fractions (e.g. 45/50), which I would then need to convert to a decimal on a
separate calculator. It seemed redundant to have to use two calculators to calculate my grades.
2. The site would not save your data across sessions. Since I frequented this site
throughout the semester, I found myself entering the same data over and over with few
changes from the previous time.
   
This grade calculator addresses both of those issues, without losing any of the 
smooth functionality seen in other grade calculators.
